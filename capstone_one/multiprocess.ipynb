River Revitalization Corporation, a non-profit that strives to improve the quality of life in Los Angeles by revitalizing the L.A. River corridor with sustainable land development projects. The L.A. River is at the heart of our vision to build a cleaner, greener and more connected LA.\\xa0\\nThe Details\\nWhat is a Bike-In Movie Theater? We're glad you asked. It is a pop-up event where we project an awesome movie on a building on a property with a river view. There will be food, drinks and overall merriment.\\nWhat will this money actually pay for?\\xa0Equipment rental and set up, event permits, security, cleanup costs, and the rights to the movie. If we are able to reach our goal, you can expect 3 unique movie going experiences.\\nL.A. has lots of outdoor cinema, what makes this special?\\xa0Well, the L.A. River of course! If you come an hour before the show you will have a chance to mingle with other river enthusiasts and discover the possibilities that await you along the L.A. River. You also get to enjoy a seamless car-free riding experience along the 7 mile river-adjacent bike path.What if I don't bike? No one will be turned away.

Their own personal experiences became the inspiration for the story.\\n\"Thicker than Water\" takes place in the 19th century, in the southernmost town of Anna, Illinois. Anna, an acronym for “Ain’t No Niggers Allowed,” is a rural and white Sundown Town, a settlement that forbids blacks from passing through after the sun goes down.\\n\\xa0The story follows young Jacob Warrick, a lonely, sheltered boy crippled in his right leg. After Jacob is attacked by bullies for being a cripple, a mysterious onlooker, Silas saves him.  Jacob bargains for his help in finding the missing compass. Silas agrees, and this sparks the beginning of a friendship between the boys, one filled with myth, discovery, and a powerful secret.\\nDespite telling this story from a white point of view, we\\'re very interested in keeping the music and score closer to the African-American/Yoruba tradition.  \\n\\xa0Rachel Bass (Director): Rachel Bass was born in West Chicago, Illinois.

She is currently a graduate student in Directing at Chapman University\\'s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. She is the recipient of the Director’s Guild of America Jury Award, and her thesis “Thicker than Water” was nominated for the Princess Grace Awards.\\nRyan James Lim (Producer): After graduating with his Bachelor’s Degree in Chemistry from St. Bonaventure University, Ryan James Lim moved out to the west to pursue graduate school and film making. He is currently in the dual MBA and MFA Film Producing program at Chapman University. He is also a member of Chapman’s launch group for their Interdisciplinary Program, a program that puts producers, lawyers, and business students with an entertainment focus together, giving them insight into all branches of the industry. This year alone, Ryan has been a part of 11 productions, ranging from short films and features, to virtual reality experiences.\\nYouchen Miao (Dir. of Photography): Born and raised in Beijing, China, Miao earned dual degrees in Journalism and Digital Entertainment Design from Tsinghua University.

Yujie, nonetheless, developed his own means to it. He read books, watched films, and worked on projects to reach a higher platform in editing. After graduating from college, he moved to California to advance his art at Chapman University. At Chapman, he has equipped himself with professional experience in filmmaking.

It was an enormously satisfying endeavor. \\xa0In that book I introduced a minor character, Owen Youniacutt, who is truly dear to my heart. Owen is a compilation of fellows I met when I was a big rig driver and men I encountered as owner of a manufacturing business. It’s true I stretched and exaggerated those fellows, but to me the combination makes Owen an American hero.\\nAfter the first book came out, I remember driving in Norther California when the song Mammas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys came on the radio. The tune reminded me of Owen – and really each of us – because I felt the lyrics captured the truth that people generally are a bundle of contradictions. Just because you like “smoky old pool rooms” doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy “clear mountain mornings.” And who isn’t (among us guys at least --- women have their own partialities) simultaneously drawn to “little warm puppies and children and girls of the night?”\\xa0\\nSo I came home from my business trip and started writing All Hat to showcase those paradoxes as characterized by Owen Youniacutt. Here’s a hint: when you read the book, pay attention to the difference between what Owen says and what he does, something you might not have picked up in There’s A Somebody. And although the two books are stand-alones – you don’t have to read one to understand the other – it might be fun to note the short period in There’s A Somebody when Owen drops out of the scene. Those few weeks are the entirety of All Hat.\\nYou’ve probably already watched the video above where I shamelessly beg for money, so it’s only fair I tell you where it’s going. The number one cost will be high quality printing. I’ll again use McNaughton and Gunn because I think they are the best.

Given its huge success, the series is immediately renewed for a second season. But then, trouble comes: they are sued for plagiarism, and are forced to welcome a new, unexperienced showrunner. As the situation gets worse, the producers get edgier and edgier too. Our screenwriters are now swimming in troubled waters.\\xa0\\nTHE SHOW\\nProud Members of The Writers’ Room is the first mockumentary sit-com produced by Netsity Original. The first season has six twenty-to-twenty-five-minute episodes. The whole series will be released on Netsity Original YouTube channel in a single batch. Since the show is aimed at the international market, the episodes will be available in Italian (audio), English, French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Bulgarian, and Rumanian (subs). More languages may be added to this list.\\xa0\\nWHAT NOW?\\nWe plan to start work on the show as soon as the fundraising campaign is over. As you read this, we are probably casting actors and advertising for some missing member in our technical staff. We have wonderful ideas and motivation: and now, we need your help. So thank you for supporting us.\\xa0\\nPRODUCTION TIMELINE\\nThe show will be going through the last stages of pre-production in May. By then, we will have started working with our actors on the full, final script. The shooting will take placed in Bologna between June and July. If necessary, more shooting sessions will be scheduled in September. Post-production will take up the whole month of October.\\xa0\\nCOSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS\\nThe estimate of the costs we have provided you with stems from previous fundraising campaigns we have taken as case studies. We are offering a rich variety of rewards to thank you for your support.\\xa0\\nIn addition to what explicitly indicated in the chart above, further costs should be taken into consideration, such as: insurance payment, inward and outward journeys for some members of the crew, and meals. A small sum to cover the fees charged by Kickstarter will also be required.\\xa0\\nOUR TEAM\\nYoung, talented, madly in love with cinema: our partners and staff members make up a passionate and creative team, who have given vital contribution to the constellation that we call Writer’s Room.\\xa0\\nREWARDS OUTLINE\\nABOUT UNDEAD\\nWhat the critics said about the first season of Undead\\xa0\\nWe have appeared on:\\n• Cinefacts,\\xa0 https://www.cinefacts.it/cinefacts-articolo-264/undead-stagione-1-una-webserie-zombie-italiana-tutta-da-riscoprire.html?fbclid=IwAR08qFxHP8zFyF2RnCprx3UNwdtqietQCM_FySFxVEnkKDc3PuYjYYIrv0Y\\xa0\\n• La Settima Arte,\\xa0 https://www.artesettima.it/2019/03/16/undead-lhorror-italiano-che-non-ha-paura-di-osare/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=socialnetwork&fbclid=IwAR154qWsh8xGXn1qKsdgEifWs9DsmqQ-azEl_dauUMtpxllfcV_l60ZR6cw\\xa0\\n• Gli Intoccabili,\\xa0 https://intoccabiliblog.com/2019/03/16/undead-2019-netsity-writers-room-recensione-che-cos-e/?fbclid=IwAR3TDMq_hkaYSc-WRTfL5vG9lzQCdLOJzIGq3k-roXCES87eJyc1_tT5KcQ\\xa0\\n• Der Zweifel, \\xa0https://derzweifel.com/2019/03/16/undead-writers-room/\\xa0\\nWe wish one day Undead will not be a dream anymore.

There\\'s a yearning deep within me, relentlessly luring me and my camera back to\\xa0the red-rock landscapes. I\\'m inspired by natural scenery all over, but this fascinating region has me captivated. I cannot explain it. I must answer the call.\\nIt is of course true that my passion, skill and determination as a landscape photographer has far greater potential beyond creating great wall art. It is clear that it also can inspire others in travel, adventure and conservation efforts. For that I am both humbled and grateful.\\nBut this project, in essence, is about creating art prints that you and all my backers will love - with other rewards featuring my imagery also available, including postcards and a 2016 wall calendar.\\n\"Ultimate Utah\" is Part II of my \"Spirit Of The Southwest\" photography project; one I hope to build on again in the future. This is your chance to be involved ... please take this opportunity to join me in making it reality.\\xa0\\nI self-funded Part I in September 2013, a week-long Arizona roadtrip with my wife that confirmed my connection with the landscape of this region and led to my first international photography awards.\\nUnlike on that occasion - when it was admittedly part-holiday, part-photography - this time around I will be travelling solo and my focus will entirely be on photography. As such, I\\'m confident of producing many more award-winning images.\\nWhy support this project? If you too have a great passion for the American Southwest, love landscape photography as an art form and/or are a budding photographer yourself, it\\'s a no-brainer.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you help this project get off the ground, the rewards I\\'ve created offer you a fabulous opportunity to hang\\xa0a beautiful American Southwest print on your wall\\xa0while saving about 10% on my standard pricing for prints - with the option of choosing a limited-edition release. In fact there is even a reward providing the option of choosing from any of my Australian or United States limited-edition prints available\\xa0as of November 1, 2015.\\nShould the funding goal be reached, every single backer - regardless of the pledge made - will also receive an acknowledgment of support on my blog Awe and Wonder.\\xa0If you pledge $10 or more you will additionally receive a beautiful postcard featuring one of my Arizona photographs from \"Spirit of the Southwest\" Part I; pledge $20 or more and you\\'ll receive 5 blank postcards featuring images from that trip also!\\nIn addition, help me get this project off the ground and I will extend a VIP invitation to you to the opening night of any future \"Spirit of the Southwest\" exhibition - whether held in Brisbane, the American Southwest or anywhere else in the world!\\nI am an Australian from a small community called Springfield Lakes, near the Queensland capital of Brisbane, and am an Australian Institute of Professional Photography accredited professional photographer.\\nI\\'ve won various photography awards since turning professional in early 2013, including Silver in the 2013 International Loupe Awards, 2014 AIPP Australian Professional Photography Awards and 2015 AIPP Queensland Professional Photography Awards. My success has been quite overwhelming, with my images effectively judged on par with the work of internationally-renowned landscape photographers such as Peter Lik on more than one occasion. \\nBalanced against the day-to-day activity of running a commercial photography business in and around Brisbane, personal projects such as this one are vitally important to me. It\\'s all part of my journey as a photographer.\\nMy most celebrated photograph to date - with two Silver awards, as well as being shortlisted as a Finalist in the 2014 Head On Landscape Prize as part of the world\\'s second largest photography festival - is actually a capture from the American Southwest: Monument Valley Storm (shown below).\\nI produce both limited-edition prints and open-edition prints, which are available for sale on my online artist showcase\\xa0f13 Gallery. Limited-edition releases to date allow for only 12 or 50 art prints to ever be produced and sold - and any limited-edition releases arising from this project will each be an edition of only 50 also, making them highly exclusive art pieces.\\nMy works already hang in private collections in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in public spaces, however I remain largely undiscovered, offering astute landscape photography print collectors a great opportunity.\\nI will SELF-FUND my international return flight from Brisbane to Los Angeles, as my plan is to bookend the project at the start of a trip taking in my brother-in-law\\'s wedding in Nashville in September 2015.\\nI will also SELF-FUND all my domestic/internal flights, as I will be flying between Los Angeles and Nashville regardless of this project.\\nAny costs associated with marketing this crowdfunding campaign, time spent in researching and organising the travel itinerary, and time spent in post-production - and in creating your rewards - will also be covered by myself.\\nEssentially the FUNDS RAISED through your pledges will be used to cover expenses incurred during the project itself, ie my time on the ground in the American Southwest.\\nTo clarify further, in calculating the funds needed to make the project a reality, I have factored in only a car rental (compact car for economy) to be collected from either Las Vegas or Salt Lake City (TBC) and returned to Salt Lake City, gas (based on about 1000 miles), national park entry fees, hotels and food.\\nAdditionally, of course, the funding goal set has also factored in Kickstarter\\'s fee for a successfully funded project (5%), payment processing fees (ranging from 3% to 5%) and Australia\\'s Goods and Services Tax (10%), which will also apply to pledges I receive, as well as the expense of producing the rewards (in some instances, more than 50%).\\nOverall only about 30% to 35% of the contributed funds can likely be used to cover the actual project expenses, depending upon the distribution of pledges and their associated rewards.\\nAs such, every little bit of support counts and your help is greatly appreciated!\\xa0\\nPhotography undertaken as part of this project will cover pre-dawn to post-dusk across six days in early September 2015 and will be concentrated on Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park - including incredible formations such as Delicate Arch and the Hoodoos -\\xa0plus some of the lesser known or less popular destinations in their surrounding vicinity.\\xa0\\nShould the funding goal be hit early, I will seek to\\xa0introduce stretch goals enabling the duration of the project to be extended and/or helicopter charters for aerial photography. If this happens, it\\'s possible that I may even briefly cross back into Arizona - and even revisit Monument Valley.\\xa0\\nAs such, no exact itinerary has been formulated yet. My intention is to either finish the project on September 9 or 10, 2015 ahead of my brother-in-law\\'s wedding in Nashville.\\xa0\\nThe current plan is to\\xa0fly into either Las Vegas or Salt Lake City (TBC) and make my way to one of the national parks to commence the project. I will then be setting a travel route that involves the least backtracking possible along the way.\\nThere will obviously be a lot of hiking involved during the project also and weather conditions will determine whether or not it is possible to photograph all the locations I hope to cover.\\n\\nIt\\'s fair to say, though, that in any regard my lens will be trained on many of Utah\\'s best-loved natural attractions - with an aim of capturing my unique take on them - as well as hopefully uncovering a few gems along the way.\\nTo give you an idea of the style of my photography, in addition to Monument Valley Storm\\xa0and other images from Arizona shown above, here are a few more examples of images I captured during my time in the Southwest in 2013.\\nMore of my landscape photography, including additional images from the United States and shots from my native Australia, can be viewed at f13 Gallery.\\nAs is often the case, this photography project is a constantly evolving plan with varying location ideas at each destination and the route in between. As such, in addition to my own research, I\\'m open to audience input - especially from those of you who are backing the campaign and may be interested in hanging a print of a Fred McKie photograph of a particular location on your wall.\\nIn addition to general comments and any questions you may have, if you have any thoughts, requests or suggestions of possible landscape photography subjects in Utah please don\\'t hesitate to let me know.\\nEmail: fred@fredmckie.com.au\\nEmails are encouraged throughout the project and will be responded to as time permits.

We plan a wine “salon” of sorts in the historical sense: that as a regular social gathering of eminent people (especially scholars, intellectuals, writers, artists). Blacksburg Wine Lab will be such a setting for people in Blacksburg: a refined environment for professionals and community members to meet, learn, share, and interact over wine. A unique feature of this establishment is its educational mission: not only will it feature wines from lesser-known regions of the world, but it will host regular wine lessons, lectures, special guests, and special events: a true community center with wine as a common denominator.\\nWhat Makes Us Different?\\nUnlike traditional bars (even other wine bars) and retail wine shops, we plan to have a diverse selection of products available on a regular basis. Typically, other wine bar menus and wine stores are predictable, offering typically a California Chardonnay, a light Pinot Grigio from Italy, a Malbec from Argentina, a big bold Cabernet Sauvignon, a fruity light wine, a true Champagne, and an alternative cheaper fizzy wine from somewhere else. This standard approach is taken by retail establishments so they can offer a little something for everyone that comes in and therefore pleases the greatest number of people, makes them comfortable by offering a variety of the most popular wines that they can recognize by name/style, and thus increases sales; in other words, their wine selections are a mile wide and an inch deep.\\nBlacksburg Wine Lab aims to turn convention on its head, and do the exact opposite. While we aim to serve many of the most recognizable basics that customers are familiar with, we plan to also be serving 12 to 15 wines every month from a lesser-known wine region of the world (e.g. Sardinia, Loire Valley, Greece, Georgia, China), with every new month focusing on a new region, and educating the clientele about these wines along the way. While the focus will be on a single region’s wines, we will also plan on serving a great diversity of wines from that region, meaning that there will be a variety of red wines, white wines, rosé wines, and sparkling and dessert wines from that region, of differing qualities and costs. \\nThe approach is monolithic only in its focus on a unique region every month; the diversity of products offered will appeal to all tastes and preferences. Our selection will aim to be an inch wide and a mile deep on a rotating basis and we believe this will have the effect of keeping\\ncustomers engaged, intrigued, and enlightened about the newest and exciting undiscovered wines of the world. This monthly rotation of wine focus has the added benefit of essentially making the menu brand new every month, and the bar itself a constantly rejuvenated source of inspiration and culinary adventure. A new month, a whole new wine bar, keeping clients always wanting to come back for more, to discover unknown territories of wine. But the uniqueness doesn’t end there, and our educational mission is embraced at multiple scales.\\nThe Space:\\xa0The planned look for the interior of Blacksburg Wine Lab is open and airy; refined and elegant, yet relaxed and comfortable. Expose open overhead, recycled vintage barn wood, concrete counter tops and flooring combine to illicit a industrial/post-industrial decor. Art displayed on the walls will focus on the theme of science, technology, experimentation, and laboratories, and we are working with a master glass blower/artist to create decorative pieces utilizing antique lab equipment and glass, thus melding art and science together into a space that elicits fascination and curiosity.\\nThe Wine Lab includes both a front and back patio space, providing the possibility of additional seating. The front patio will be surrounded by tasteful fencing and planters allowing for a peaceful scenery. The back porch is already partially covered, partially open-air, sunken “private garden” that produces an organic space/secret oasis feel in this back-patio area. Our aim is to utilize local businesses and experts as much as possible to truly create a community space that has been built by the community.\\n$5 High Five\\xa0Donate five to us, and we give you a digital hi-five right back, along with our undying gratitude for your support!

I was a few years out of college, making my living playing online poker, when the US Department of Justice shut the industry down. Unemployed and in debt, I did what any twenty-something in 2011 would do: I started a blog.\\nThe idea was simple. Each week, I would do something different to earn money and then write about it. Sometimes the jobs went well. For example, photos from the time I was paid to dress up as a firefighter at a 5-year-old\\'s birthday party made for a fantastic dating profile picture.\\nAnd sometimes they didn\\'t. Like when, unbeknownst to me, that same dating profile automatically uploaded a Facebook photo from the time I was the Hulk at a different party.\\nBut they almost always led to an interesting story. Over the span of several years, I tested landmine detection technology, sold my blood, auditioned for a game show, dressed in a bikini, posed as one half of a conjoined twin at a trade show and, most harrowing of all, served as a substitute teacher.\\nNow I\\'m turning that blog into a book. It features my favorite stories and new ones I never posted online. In addition, the book covers my life during that time. Because the truth is that pursuing the fun, unconventional career path isn\\'t always fun. It\\'s hard and scary and doesn\\'t pay well. I eventually had to move out of my apartment and start crashing on couches when I could no longer afford the rent. And all the while, one question kept reverberating in my head: What the hell was I doing with my life?\\nBut it turned out that writing the blog -- and this book -- also helped me find the answer.\\nThe book is written, it\\'s been edited a thousand times, the cover is being developed as we speak, but I need some help to take it the last quarter mile. That\\'s where Kickstarter comes in. I am looking to raise $4,000 to cover production, distribution, and marketing costs. And should I somehow get to $7,500, I will also record an audio version of the book.\\nToday is October 18, 2018, and I am about to hit the launch button on this campaign. It\\'ll mark over six years of working on this project, and a lifetime of wanting to be a professional author. It\\'s surprisingly frightening to be this close to my goal. It\\'s scary to reveal so many struggles and fears in such a public venue. And it\\'s even scarier to say, \"This is the thing I\\'ve been working on all this time.\"\\xa0\\nBut more than being frightened, I\\'m excited. I\\'m excited to complete this journey. I\\'m excited to share this story. And I\\'m excited to publish this book.\\xa0\\nSo let\\'s talk rewards. For starters, you can get an e-book, a paperback, or your own autographed copy of my book. And for especially generous Kickstarter backers there are several additional options, each of which also includes an autographed copy of the book.\\xa0\\nI finished working strange jobs for my blog several years ago, but in honor of this campaign, I\\'m coming out of retirement.\\xa0That means you can hire me to do an Odd Job for you.\\xa0\\n\\nFor $50, I\\'ll make a Skype call to your loved one, or record a video, where I dress in costume and serenade them with a song of your choice.\\nFor $200, I\\'ll show up and do it in person. Or I can work any other Odd Job. I can twist balloons, help you pull off the prank you\\'ve always dreamed of, be the point man for your marriage proposal, or run the atypical mission of your choice. (Check the FAQ section for a few restrictions and details for jobs located outside the Greater Boston area where I am based.)\\xa0\\nFor $300, I\\'ll do the job, then write about the whole thing on my website (www.jonathankrieger.com), just like I did when I was working on my blog.\\n\\nFinally, since one of my jobs was as a bar trivia host, I\\'m turning the first half of my book launch party into a giant bar trivia game. We\\'ll give away over $1500 worth of prizes, play some music, and have a great time. After that comes an author Q&A moderated by writer/podcaster/internet sensation Margaret Willison. (More details on the event, including time, location, and a description of the prizes, can be found in the FAQ section.) And if trivia isn\\'t your thing, that\\'s fine.

From its Native American history to the antebellum, from the Civil War to civil rights – the Black Belt of Alabama embodies the true South. Our goal is not to document tourist-driven, southern clichés but, instead, to document the true character that encompasses all that we love about Alabama. It\\'s worth noting that we\\'ve previously collaborated on a 2005 photographic study of an abandoned “Creosote Creek” community in Tarrant, AL – from which two photos can be found in the \"Photography\" section below.\\u2028\\u2028\\nInspired by the works of photographers William Christenberry & Walker Evans, Rural Studio founder Samuel Mockbee, and Let Us Now Praise Famous Men author, James Agee, we will be visiting small towns in many of the 17 counties, exploring their state and county roads – both dirt and paved, talking with residents, and documenting what we discover along the way. The funding for this project will pay for travel costs and supporter rewards as well as printing the book itself, shipping within the U.S., and more.\\u2028\\u2028\\nContents of the 80-page, 8.5” x 11”, perfect-bound softcover book will feature fine art and editorial photography, shot digitally and on film, as well as liner notes, detailed captions and assorted ephemera picked up along the trip.

In addition to designing The Black Belt of Alabama, other book design credits include Samuel Mockbee and the Rural Studio: Community Architecture (Birmingham Museum of Art) and Eerie Von’s Misery Obscura (Dark Horse).\\nBefore returning to live in his hometown of Lancaster, PA, Tom lived in New York City, Los Angeles, and Birmingham, AL between 1993-2008.\\nHis work in both design and photography can be viewed online at Man Alive Creative as well as Tumblr.• Jennifer was born and raised in Birmingham, AL while her family’s presence in Randolph County, Alabama dates back more than a century.

Together they served up a smorgasbord of pub favourites, and even came up with a few creations of their own, from the highly successful cheese souffle with Marmite reduction to the not-quite-so-successful carrot and red cabbage soup (the world just wasn't ready for a bright pink soup back in 2010).\\nThe Taverner's Table Story\\nDan and Jamie went their separate ways in 2012, but stayed in touch. In the summer of 2014, when Jamie discovered that Dan had developed an obsession with crafting chutneys and mustards using the finest ingredients and carefully selected ales and ciders, he knew that this was something worth sharing. The boys put their heads together, refining the recipes, sourcing jars, designing labels and reading through pages and pages of food regulations.\\nNot content with developing just one, two or even three varieties of chutney, Dan and Jamie came up with an exciting idea; they would develop a new chutney and a new mustard each month, using their favourite craft beers, ciders, real ales and other lovely booze - all to be delivered directly to your door. The concept of the world's first chutney subscription service was born!\\nOur Products\\nThe first delicious offerings from the Taverner's Table are ready to share, including a special something just for Christmas:\\n'The Legless Reindeer'\\n\\xa0A lightly spiced, warm, Christmas chutney flavoured with Pimm's Winter Cup. Perfect for the cold meats on Boxing Day.\\n'Dark Side of the Spoon'\\n\\xa0A deep, complex chutney, balancing the bittersweet of dark Eclipse ale with the tang of red onion and balsamic vinegar.\\n'The Flaming Dragon'\\nA jet black, spicy mustard made with strong Black Dragon cider and bramley apples. Add to anything from roasted pork belly to sausage sandwiches.\\nThe Big Idea\\nThe money you pledge for the Taverner's Table will go towards supplying you with a range of delicious foodstuffs and exciting gifts, but it will also go towards taking our ambitious journey to the next stage. To deliver on the vision of a full-blown chutney and mustard subscription and delivery service, we need to invest in a bespoke website with e-commerce features, professional label printing, a franking machine, renting a commercial kitchen, and a rubber stamp, so that everything we send out can be given the Taverner's Table seal of approval.
